<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I have watched this seven times I think. Very beautiful</p>
<h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
<p>Watched this twice. Very emotional each time I watch.
  Also I like the diverse cast.<p>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>Watched as a kid and thought the robots were cute. 
  Now I watch and realize some of the plot ideas are very deep.</p>
